### <a name="twofactor"></a> Two-Factor Authentication

"WordPress two-factor authentication (or WordPress 2-step verification) adds an important extra layer of protection to your WordPress siteâ€™s login and admin area by requiring 1) a password and 2) a secondary time-sensitive code to login." - [iThemes Security Pro](https://ithemes.com/security/wordpress-two-factor-authentication/)

Leap Spark enabled Two-Factor by deafult on any website we create. To setup 2FA for your user account, follow these steps:

1. In the WordPress dashboard, find **Users**
2. Hover over this item and then select **Your Profile**
3. Scroll to the **Two-Factor Authentication Options** panel
4. Select the option that works best for you. If you have no experience with Two-Factor security, we would recommend you start with the **Email** option. 

Now, whenever you login you will be presented with an additional field that asks for a **Authentication Code**. If you selected **Email** in the previous steps, a 6 digit code will be emailed to you. Simply copy/paste this code to login.

For information on how to set up a **Time Based One-Time Password** using **Google Authenticator**, visit the [iThemes Documentation](https://ithemes.com/2014/05/28/set-two-factor-authentication-wordpress-site-google-authenticator/)
