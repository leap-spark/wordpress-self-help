The only required field for posts is a **title**. Everything else can remain blank or default and still function.


### <a name="choosingFormat"></a> Choosing a Format

Out of the box, WordPress offers eith different post formats in their pre-installed themes. These can be changed on a theme by theme basis so you may not always see the same types

1. Choose the Format that best describes your content
1. Click **Update**, **Preview**, or **Save Draft** to view or save your changes


### <a name="specifyingCategories"></a> Specifying Categories

To assign a post to a specific categorie(s), simply select the category in the panel named **Categories**.
