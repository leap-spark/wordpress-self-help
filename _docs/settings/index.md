- [Hiding Your Site From Search Engines](#hide)



### <a name="hide"></a> Hide From Search Engines

This option allows you to have somewhat of control over what search engines are indexing. That is, what pages they discover. While this setting is helpful to prevent Google or Bing from crawling your website, it does not guarantee that it will not show up in web searches.

1. In the WordPress dashboard look for **Settings > Reading**
2. Tick the checkbox that says **Discourage search engines from indexing this site**
