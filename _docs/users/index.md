### <a name="addUser"></a> Add New User

1. In the WordPress dashboard, go to **Users > Add New**
2. Create a unique username. We recommend that there are no spaces and that the username is different than the email address. 
3. Enter the users email address
4. Optionally you can set a password by clicking the **Show Password** button and then entering a custom password. If you do not click this button, then a password will be generated automatically
5. You can optionally check the box that sends the new user an email notification when you create the account. This email will contain a link to login, as well as their username and password.
6. Set their role. As a general rule of thumb, you should grant the minimum amount of access that is required in their role. That is, don't give someone admin access if all they are doing is editing blog posts. That way if their account ever gets compromised, you don't have to worry about them having administrative access.
7. Click the **Add New User** button



### <a name="deleteUser"></a> Delete a User
